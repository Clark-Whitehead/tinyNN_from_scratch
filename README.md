#### Install Jupyter Notebooks if you don't have it yet:

```
pip install notebook
```
#### Start Jupyter Notebooks server( Then navigate to where you cloned this repository ):

jupyter notebook --notebook-dir ~/

I saw this picture and thought it would be fun and quick to build from scratch.

#### How to run:

#### 1. In order to access the website, the python application must be running. This can be done by cloning this repository locally: 

```
git clone git@github.com:Clark-Whitehead/data_viz_final_project.git
```

#### 2. After cloning, navigate into the repository's directory:

```
cd data_viz_final_project
```

#### 3. Run the python program (note: make sure python3 is installed on your computer):

```
python3 app.py
```

#### 4. Finally, open an internet browswer of your choice and navigate to the following url:

```
http://localhost:8050/
```

### 5. If a browser doesn't open automatically for Jupyter Notebooks, copy and paste the link from your terminal that looks like the following:

<p>http://localhost:8888/?token=daffb014698fc671455b51ed6558ff555915020403571573</p>
