#### A very simple perceptron

#### Install Jupyter Notebooks if you don't have it yet:

```
pip install notebook
```
#### Start Jupyter Notebooks server( Then navigate to where you cloned this repository ):

jupyter notebook --notebook-dir ~/

<p>http://localhost:8888/?token=daffb014698fc671455b51ed6558ff555915020403571573</p>
